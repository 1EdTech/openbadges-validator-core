Badgecheck
=====

BadgeCheck is a python package designed to verify the validity of Open Badges
based on a variety of input sources and present a useful interface for
accessing their properties and validation information.

BadgeCheck is produced by Concentric Sky. https://concentricsky.com

Some dependencies on Django remain, but the goal is to eliminate them and
present BadgeCheck as a standalone python package with a command line
interface.

Usage and installation instructions coming.
